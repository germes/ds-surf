## Linear Algebra Course project

The aim of this project is an implementation of the SURF algorithm in python and investigation of the Linear Algebra complexity used in the SURF.
The SURF method (Speeded Up Robust Features) is a fast and robust algorithm for local, similarity invariant representation and comparison of images.

List of files:
1. include/surf_lib.py - library with implementation of SURF and SURF_matcher
2. images - contains images that were used for testing
3. output - result of testing SURF on the attached images
4. surf_detect_keypoints.py - script to detect keypoints on the provided image
5. surf_match_multi.py - script to compare images using SURF
